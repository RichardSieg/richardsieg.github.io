Hi, I'm Richard! I design and build end-to-end Machine Learning solutions at <a href="https://www.how.fm/" target="_blank">how.fm</a> in Cologne, Germany. Mostly, I am interested in Natural Language Processing - in particular for instructional texts.

I have a background in Discrete Mathematics and received my PhD at the University of Osnabrück in Combinatorial Algebra.

I love teaching! Currently, I supervise Data Science seminars at the <a href="https://www.th-koeln.de/" target="_blank">Technische Hochschule Köln</a>.

Outside of work, I am DJing at clubs, bars, and weddings and I love to play music. I am a passionate SV Werder Bremen fan and love to play RPG video games.
