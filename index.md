👋 Hi, I'm Richard! I design and build end-to-end Machine Learning solutions at <a href="https://www.how.fm/" target="_blank">how.fm</a> in Cologne, Germany. Mostly, I am interested in Natural Language Processing - in particular for instructional texts.

👨‍🔬 My research interests are the extraction of structured data from documents and text simplification.

👨‍💻 I have a background in Discrete Mathematics and received my PhD at the University of Osnabrück in Combinatorial Algebra.

👨‍🏫 I love teaching! Currently, I supervise Data Science seminars at the <a href="https://www.th-koeln.de/" target="_blank">Technische Hochschule Köln</a>.

🪩 Outside of work, I am interested in anything that is music related and I occasionally DJ at clubs, bars, and weddings. I am a passionate SV Werder Bremen fan and love to play RPG video games.
